# 🎬 Recommender System  

## 📜 Overview  
This project demonstrates a **Movie Recommender System** built using collaborative filtering techniques, including Alternating Least Squares (ALS) with and without latent factors. The system efficiently predicts user ratings for movies and ranks recommendations.  

## ⚙️ Features  
- Implements data preprocessing for user and movie interactions.  
- Utilizes ALS for bias correction and latent factor modeling.  
- Visualizes movie traits using PCA for dimensionality reduction.  
- Identifies and ranks the most and least polarizing movies based on ratings.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Programming Languages**: Python 🐍  
- **Libraries**: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib 📊  
- **Visualization**: Seaborn, PCA 📉  
- **Data Handling**: Pickle, CSV 📂  

## 🚀 Getting Started  
Run the Jupyter Notebook for step-by-step implementation and visualization.  

## 📁 Project Structure  
- **`Recommender system first draft.ipynb`**: Main implementation of the recommender system (maybe changed later, stay tuned 😄).  
- **Data files**: Includes ratings and movies datasets (MovieLens Dataset, link: [MovieLens Dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/)).  

## 📊 Visualizations  
- Degree distribution for users and movies.  
- PCA-based movie trait vectors in 2D space.  
- Rating distributions by genre and polarization analysis.  

## 🔮 Future Enhancements  
- Integrate hybrid recommendation techniques.  
- Extend to real-time recommendation systems.  
- Build a website 🌐.  
- Re-implement the code with JAX ⚡.
